# Portable Job System

openQ4 now owns a portable bounded job service for coarse engine work. It is
available in client, tool, and dedicated builds without changing Quake 4 asset,
save, demo, or network formats. Its first production consumer is the learned
level-load read/decode pipeline: workers read independently opened,
identity-checked source handles, perform the PK4 inflation reached by those
reads, validate supported source framing plus whole-buffer integrity, and
publish a sealed immutable DTO. Resource owners still perform asset-specific
parse/decode, validation, adoption, and upload on their established main path;
no live renderer, audio, archive, or game state is mutated by those jobs.

The architecture was informed by id Software's GPLv3
[Doom 3 BFG `idParallelJobList`](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG/blob/1caba1979589971b5ed44e315d9ead30b278d8b4/neo/idlib/ParallelJobList.h).
The implementation is original openQ4 code. It deliberately replaces BFG's
platform-specific worker assumptions and spinning list wait with portable C++
threads and condition variables, explicit saturation, and cooperative
cancellation. Both projects use GPLv3-compatible licensing; no BFG source file
was copied into this subsystem, so the audited BFG-lineage source-file count is
unchanged.

## Runtime policy and lifecycle

`idCommon` initializes the engine-owned service before commands and higher-level
runtime systems can submit work. Shutdown stops admission, requests cancellation,
waits for running callers and workers, and joins every worker before network,
session, renderer, or other subsystem teardown begins.

The startup-only controls are:

- `jobs_enable 1` enables threaded scheduling. Setting it to `0` never discards
  work; accepted lists execute inline in deterministic insertion order.
- `jobs_deterministic 1` selects the same synchronous implementation for tests
  and debugging. Dedicated builds default this setting to `1`, so they create no
  background job workers unless explicitly configured otherwise; threaded
  client execution requires `jobs_enable 1` with `jobs_deterministic 0`.
- `jobs_numThreads 0` reserves one hardware thread when possible and clamps the
  worker count to 1-32. An explicit value selects that bounded count.
- `jobs_queueCapacity 64` bounds admitted lists and accepts values from 1-1024.

Synchronous work participates in the same active-list and quiescence contract as
threaded work. A concurrent `CancelAll`, `WaitAll`, or shutdown therefore sees
and joins an inline list running on another submitting thread. Concurrent inline
submissions sleep until their submit sequence reaches the front rather than
spinning.

### Level-load read/decode consumer

The level-load manager validates an exact learned manifest and applies its own
entry, per-file, staging/decode aggregate-byte, and read/decode chunk budgets
before creating one high-priority list. Every candidate file is opened through
ordinary VFS and pure-PK4 policy on the main thread, and its current path, size,
loose timestamp, and PK4 checksum must match before admission. Workers perform
bounded reads, PK4 inflation, typed framing validation for supported RIFF/WAVE,
Ogg, PNG, and JPEG sources, and whole-buffer transport/SHA-256 integrity walks with
cooperative cancellation. DDS and other owner-specific formats remain opaque.
Complete results become sealed immutable DTOs backed by shared byte arrays;
partial, malformed, late, failed, or cancelled results are never published.

When an owner later opens a resource, the normal VFS lookup runs first. Only an
already-ready exact-identity result may replace the bytes behind that authorized
handle, without waiting. Image, sound, model, world, collision, declaration,
GUI, effect, skin, animation, and raw-file owners therefore keep their ordinary
asset-specific parse/decode/adopt/upload behavior and source fallback. Map
failure, unload, filesystem restart, module reload, and shutdown cancel and join
the generation before dependent state is released.

`com_levelLoadModernization 0` disables the complete experimental consumer;
when explicitly enabled, `com_levelLoadPreload 0` disables preload without
disabling validated generated model/world/collision payloads. If the scheduler is deterministic,
disabled, saturated, or unavailable, the admitted bounded batch runs inline;
unadmitted sources continue through ordinary VFS reads. The exact campaign key,
budgets, controls, rollback, and still-pending promotion evidence are documented
in [Level-Load Cache Modernization](loading-cache-modernization.md).

## Submission contract

Each `idJobList` declares fixed job and dependency capacities when it is created.
The implementation also fails closed above 1,048,576 jobs or 256 dependencies
per list. Combined with the configured active-list bound, this places a finite
upper limit on admitted work. Scheduler list and worker storage is reserved
before workers start; admission, dependency refresh, cancellation, and teardown
do not grow scheduler-owned containers. Job functions receive their payload,
worker index, and an `idJobCancellationToken`; payload ownership and lifetime
remain the caller's responsibility through the list's terminal state.

Admission returns an explicit `idJobSubmitResult`. In particular,
`QUEUE_FULL` leaves the list in its building state so the owner can wait for its
own safe join point and retry. Work is never silently dropped or placed in an
unbounded overflow queue. Callers must handle every non-success result; the
service does not guess whether blocking, inline fallback, or cancellation is
safe for a consumer.

Dependencies are deliberately chronological: a list may depend only on a list
already submitted to the same service. Self-dependencies, duplicate edges,
foreign-service lists, unsubmitted dependencies, and reverse edges into an
already-submitted list fail closed. This makes a dependency cycle
unrepresentable. A dependent list sleeps until all prerequisites complete and
is cancelled if a prerequisite fails or is cancelled.

Lists have low, normal, or high priority. Higher priority wins initially, while
every skipped runnable list gains a scheduling age. At the starvation threshold,
aged lists enter a primary oldest-age selection class which ignores base
priority; equal ages use the monotonic submit sequence. A continuously runnable
low-priority list therefore runs after a bounded number of dispatches even when
nine or more earlier high-priority lists remain runnable. Selection is
deterministic even though completion timing with multiple workers is necessarily
concurrent.

Cancellation is cooperative. Jobs that have not started are accounted for and
never invoked; running jobs must poll `context.IsCancellationRequested()` and
leave their own data in a safe state. List waits, worker waits, dependency waits,
and shutdown waits all use condition variables. There is no spin or sleep-poll
loop in the scheduler.

## Diagnostics and validation

`jobsStats` prints current admission, queue high-water, running/sleeping worker,
completion, rejection, cancellation, failure, wake, priority-promotion,
execution-time, and wait-time counters. Per-list status and timing counters are
also available through the C++ API.

`jobsSelfTest` exercises engine-service execution, dependency ordering, batch
work, and counters in either threaded or synchronous mode. Automation should
require the exact versioned success prefix:

```text
jobsSelfTest PASS v1
```

Engine shutdown emits this exact clean-quiescence marker only after all accepted
work has reached a terminal state and every worker has joined:

```text
jobsShutdown PASS v1 initialized=0 queued=0 running=0
```

The focused native test covers deterministic inline execution, worker
parallelism, fixed capacities, retryable saturation, dependency and failure
propagation, self/cycle rejection, cooperative cancellation, low-priority aging,
threaded shutdown, and cancellation/join of an inline job submitted from another
thread. `tools/tests/parallel_job_system.py` keeps the production lifecycle,
public contract, build registration, and documentation wired into the default
validation suite.

## Consumer boundary and promotion evidence

Production consumers must have immutable inputs, caller-owned result storage,
and an explicit main-thread join point. The learned preload consumer meets that
contract with a worker-produced framing/integrity DTO whose generation, semantic
type, authoritative source identity, frame metadata, transport checksum,
SHA-256 integrity, and backing bytes are sealed before publication. This is a
real decode stage, but it deliberately stops before asset-specific owner parsing
or transformation. Future image/audio/model decode, transcode, upload, or
generated-cache preparation jobs require their own detached result and
main-owner adoption contract. Archive mutation, live game-state mutation, and
renderer API calls from arbitrary workers remain out of bounds.

The current light-grid CPU integration lives inside a dynamically loaded renderer
module. That module does not import the engine's `jobSystem` through
`RenderModuleAPI`, so wiring it directly would create an unresolved/duplicate
service boundary and unclear shutdown ownership. Light-grid work should adopt
the service only after a narrow renderer job import or engine-owned work packet
contract is designed; it remains outside this consumer migration.

The learned level-load read/framing pipeline is the first production migration.
`jobs_enable 1` and `jobs_enable 0` must still produce identical owner-visible
results even though one may stage reads concurrently and the other runs the
same bounded work inline. The 2026-08-19 current-build validation closed the
earlier local Milestone A lifecycle gate:
jobs-on and jobs-off `game/storage1` produced identical engine TGA bytes and
matching game state; both OpenGL modes and jobs-on Vulkan completed the repeated
`game/mcc_2` -> `game/storage1` -> `game/storage2` -> `game/storage1` ->
`game/tram1` campaign with clean shutdown markers; and five dedicated-server
runs each exited normally with exactly one synchronous self-test and one clean
shutdown marker.

Those runs used an immutable development runtime built from an uncommitted
source tree. Release promotion still requires the same evidence to be retained
from clean source and a freshly staged final package. Multiplayer evidence must
retain `ui_autoJoin 1` unless the join flow itself is under test. Milestone B's
new consumer parity, cancellation, corruption, memory, and timing evidence is
also still pending in
[loading-cache-modernization.md](loading-cache-modernization.md); the integrated
consumer is not itself a final performance or platform claim.
