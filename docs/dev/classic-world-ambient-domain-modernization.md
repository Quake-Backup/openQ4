# Shared Classic World Ambient/Material Domain

## Status

The second Milestone D classic-frame domain is implemented as an experimental,
default-off path for complete eligible 3D world ambient/material views. OpenGL
and Vulkan consume the same ordered, per-draw evaluated material records. The
established classic view remains the supported default and the whole-view
rollback.

Implementation, dependency-light validation, and local Windows stock-runtime
image/ownership/rollback evidence are complete for both backends. The retained
OpenGL and Vulkan captures prove exact option-off/on output for one eligible
view and exact complete-view fallback for one deform blocker. These are
development-worktree results, not clean committed-package or cross-platform
release-promotion evidence.

This is an ambient/material ownership boundary, not modern interaction-lighting
ownership. The established depth prepass remains authoritative, and any view
containing non-owned interaction, shadow, light-grid, fog/blend, special-effect,
GUI, or post work remains completely on its established backend walker.

The implementation is original openQ4 work. It incorporates no external source
code and changes no stock Quake 4 asset.

## Domain boundary

The domain considers complete ordinary 3D world `RC_DRAW_VIEW` work. A view is
eligible only when it is a normal world scene with an enabled ambient packet,
contains no non-owned packet work, and every original source surface can be
classified, matched, evaluated, resolved, and preflighted in source order.
The only benign render-flag mask is `RF_NO_GUI | RF_PENUMBRA_MAP |
RF_PRIMARY_VIEW`; any other flag rejects the view.

For an eligible view, the shared path preserves:

- original surface and repeated ambient-stage order;
- exact stage conditions and evaluated RGBA values;
- 2x3 texture matrices, blend factors, color/depth write masks, depth
  comparison, culling, fixed-function alpha comparison, explicit texgen,
  vertex-color mode, and polygon offset;
- generation-checked texture-resource identity and sampler state;
- geometry, instance/model-view and projection matrices, viewport, and
  scissors;
- inactive and recognized no-op passes as ordered coverage records rather than
  silently deleting them; and
- a deterministic complete-view hash and per-backend coverage report.

The first version deliberately rejects portal skies, suppress-in-subview and
in-world GUI materials, subviews and mirrors, editor/render-demo mutations,
clip planes, global material overrides, BSE/outline/dynamic-texcoord special
surfaces, unsealed or non-admitted material deforms and skinned geometry,
weapon/model depth hacks, negative
scale, decals and decal-color streams, post-process sorting, synthetic or
missing spaces, current-render/depth images, cinematics, dynamic/defaulted/
unloaded images, custom programs, non-explicit texgen, player-visibility
surface work, unsupported fixed-function state, and every bounded-pool or stale
resource failure. One rejection keeps the complete view classic.

Unpacketized or backend-local view mutations are also explicit blockers:
visible light lists, portal-distance fades, a positive forced-ambient floor,
cel/world-outline work, overdraw or single-triangle diagnostics, ambient/render
skip modes, same-view blur/AL special-effect commands, prepared
offscreen render targets, and a non-swapchain Vulkan render scope. A benign
zero-mask special-effect command is a no-op rather than a false blocker.

Packet categories with active stencil-shadow, shadow-map, ARB2-interaction,
light-grid, deferred, forward+, fog/blend, SSAO, motion-blur, bloom, authored
post, special-effect, GUI, or present work are explicit whole-view blockers.
Only the depth and ambient packet categories may participate in this first
domain.

## Depth and phase contract

The shared domain owns ambient/material color work only. It does not replace or
redraw the established depth prepass. Before a view can be published, every
opaque or perforated ambient draw must have a matching `RENDER_PASS_DEPTH`
packet for the same source surface, material, geometry, and instance. A
translucent ambient draw has no depth-packet prerequisite. Missing or mismatched
coverage rejects the complete view.

An authored stage `hasAlphaTest` remains coverage metadata for the established
depth pass; it is not reapplied as an ambient color test. The world compiler can
therefore retain such a stage only because the complete-view transaction proves
the matching depth prerequisite. Fixed-function alpha-comparison bits that the
classic color walker actually executes remain sealed in the evaluated color
pass.

World materials are split at the established fog boundary:

- material sort values below `SS_MEDIUM` execute in the pre-fog phase;
- material sort values from `SS_MEDIUM` up to the rejected post-process range
  execute in the post-fog phase.

Both backends submit the pre-fog records, leave the established fog position in
the frame sequence intact, and then submit the post-fog records. This phase
split preserves ordering without claiming ownership of fog or blend lights.

## Shared record flow

1. Front-end scene packets identify materials actually referenced by
   `RENDER_PASS_AMBIENT` world draws. Intrinsic material class does not decide
   admission.
2. `MaterialResourceTable` compiles those references into a distinct bounded
   world-pass pool. Every record uses `RENDERER_MATERIAL_PASS_SURFACE`,
   `RENDERER_PROGRAM_FIXED`, enabled depth testing, the authored depth-write
   bit, and a translated `LESS`, `EQUAL`, or `ALWAYS` comparison.
3. `ClassicWorldAmbientDomain` walks every original surface transactionally,
   matches the ambient packet stream and depth prerequisites, evaluates each
   authored pass once against the bounded instance-register block, resolves
   every opaque texture id, classifies the pre/post-fog phase, and hashes the
   stable evaluated contract.
4. The view publishes its draw and evaluated-pass spans only after the complete
   transaction succeeds. A failure rolls the arenas back to their checkpoints
   and publishes only a precise fallback reason.
5. OpenGL and Vulkan preflight the complete prepared view before the first
   shared ambient draw. Each backend then submits only sealed `DRAW` records,
   accounts for all inactive/no-op records, and records one owned or fallback
   outcome for the view.

## Backend execution

The OpenGL adapter completes geometry/cache, texture, sampler, state, scissor,
capacity, and coverage preflight before committing the first pre-fog draw. The
Vulkan adapter completes geometry offsets, descriptors, exact pipeline keys,
render-scope, state, scissor, capacity, and coverage preflight before the view's
depth clear or first framebuffer-affecting command.

The actual shared consumers do not reread `shaderStage_t`, `GetStage`, or raw
`shaderRegisters`; those inputs are sealed by the front-end transaction. The
legacy draw-surface pointer remains only as a bounded geometry submission
bridge.

Neither backend can return to the classic ambient walker after its first shared
draw. Any pre-commit failure leaves the established complete ambient walk
untouched. An unexpected post-commit coverage mismatch is diagnostic only, so
the engine cannot double-render the view while attempting a late fallback.

## Control and diagnostics

`r_rendererSharedWorldAmbient` is the single cross-backend control:

- `0` (default): every 3D world view uses the established classic ambient path;
- `1`: a complete eligible view may use the shared domain; any rejection uses
  the complete classic view.

The option is independent of `r_rendererSharedGui`. Requesting it also prevents
the older aggregate modern-visible path from suppressing or recreating ambient
work before the complete-view transaction is decided. Stock-baseline and
gameplay-benchmark tooling explicitly force the option off unless a run is
intentionally collecting shared-domain evidence.

`gfxInfo` reports whether ownership was requested, prepared, and frame-valid;
world/ready/fallback view and surface counts; evaluated, drawable, inactive,
active-no-op, pre-fog, and post-fog pass counts; the deterministic hash; status;
and OpenGL/Vulkan owned/fallback coverage. Material-table diagnostics separately
report world-referenced, eligible, fallback, pass-pool, overflow, and first
failure information.

Use these renderer commands for focused validation:

```text
rendererContractsSelfTest
rendererMaterialResourceTableSelfTest
rendererClassicWorldAmbientDomainSelfTest
gfxInfo
```

The dependency-light tests cover the distinct packet-derived world-pass pool,
fixed surface/program/depth semantics, depth-prerequisite and phase vocabulary,
bounded transaction reset and stable hashing, and backend coverage accounting.
The static `renderer_classic_world_ambient_domain.py` regression additionally
locks down complete GL/Vulkan preflight-before-commit ordering, the pre-fog / fog
/ post-fog split, sealed consumer bodies, conservative default/bootstrap state,
benchmark/baseline isolation, and validation-workflow registration.

## Local runtime evidence

Runtime qualification used stock assets, a bordered 1280x720 window, and the
engine `screenshot` command. The exact stock map/view/camera and isolation
settings are retained by each harness report; no custom map, material, or shader
was added.

The gameplay harness registers the controlled stock `sp-mv2-ambient` case on
`maps/tools/mv2`. Use its exact validation-matrix command:

```powershell
python tools\tests\renderer_gameplay_benchmark.py --profile world-ambient --pacing-only --no-gpu-timers
```

The final profile launches with `ui_showGun 0`, `g_showHud 0`, and
`r_multiSamples 0`. After the normal spawn it runs `noclip`, then
`setviewpos 0 0 256 80 0 0`. Its post-map controls select the fast direct
no-post path, set `r_postAA 0`, select an unmatched `r_singleLight`, and disable
subview, light-grid, player-visibility overlay, portal-distance-fade, cel, and
debug islands while leaving ambient, deform, and normal rendering enabled. The
exact post-map set is:

```text
g_renderFastNoPost 1
g_renderFastNoPostDirect 1
r_postAA 0
r_singleLight 2147483647
r_skipSubviews 1
r_useLightGrid 0
r_skipPlayerVisibilityEffects 1
r_portalsDistanceCull 0
r_forceAmbient 0
r_celShading 0
r_celShadingWorld 0
r_showOverDraw 0
r_singleTriangle 0
r_skipAmbient 0
r_skipNewAmbient 0
r_skipDeforms 0
r_skipRender 0
```

It does not set `r_skipPostProcess` or `r_skipGuiShaders` and uses no
replacement asset. The base command retains the default-off comparison; append
`--set-cvar r_rendererSharedWorldAmbient=1` for the enabled run and select
Vulkan with `--render-api vk`. Because these are controlled visual and ownership
captures, `--pacing-only --no-gpu-timers` deliberately prevents them from being
mistaken for promotable per-map CPU/GPU budget evidence.

The safe matrix retained at `.tmp/renderer-validation/world-ambient-final-2`
also passed all three selected cases: `renderer-foundation-selftests`,
`renderer-default-safety-selftest`, and `renderer-vk-clear-startup`.

Two additional OpenGL lifecycle captures passed. The live-toggle run retained
at `.tmp/renderer-gameplay/world-ambient-gl-toggle-final` first reported owned
coverage with `requested=1` and `GL=1/0`, then reported `prepared=0` and
`status=empty` after the setting changed to `0`; its final engine TGA matched the
option-off reference exactly. The partial-video-restart run at
`.tmp/renderer-gameplay/world-ambient-gl-restart-final` reported owned coverage
before and after `vid_restart partial`, with no stale/fallback outcome, the final
stable hash `dc18ed8c0539bbfc`, and an exact final engine-TGA match. Both final
lifecycle screenshots have the eligible OpenGL reference SHA-256
`3050cb852ebf8a7ba50b847926ab52255edbb19ded8545ccfe4f3f5683708334`.

This completes the local implementation/runtime gate. The evidence comes from a
development worktree and does not replace a clean committed-package recapture
or target-platform/driver qualification before promotion.

## Remaining Milestone D work

The GUI and world ambient/material corridors are joined by the
[fixed-classic interaction domain](classic-interaction-domain-modernization.md)
and [fog/blend domain](classic-fog-blend-domain-modernization.md) as the first
four complete shared classic-frame domains. The interaction domain accepts
eligible unshadowed and shadow-coupled views; its shadow extension covers
stencil, projected/CSM/parallel, point, mixed, and hybrid ownership with
dynamic/perforated mapped casters and atomic translucent-moment fallback. The
fog/blend implementation seals the complete eligible phase for both backends;
native/static and controlled GL/Vulkan runtime qualification pass, while
authored-stock and release promotion remain open.
These domains still do not make the whole classic frame modern.

The independent default-off
[material-deform contract](classic-deform-domain-modernization.md) now admits
sealed completed or intentional-empty CPU deform results. The earlier
`shaderDemos/move` evidence remains the conservative
`r_rendererSharedDeform 0` rollback baseline; deform-enabled qualification uses
the dedicated profile and requires nonempty ownership plus exact same-backend
parity.

The completed cinematic/authored-post corridor now seals eligible root
video/audio views and complete authored post tails; see [Shared Classic
Cinematic and Authored-Post Transaction](classic-cinematic-post-domain-modernization.md).
Render-demo and Raven special-frame ownership now have a dedicated sealed
[transaction](classic-special-frame-domain-modernization.md). The next
recommended implementation target is **direct special-subview ownership**. Do
not skip ahead to temporal presentation or PBR/advanced-lighting Milestones E/F.
