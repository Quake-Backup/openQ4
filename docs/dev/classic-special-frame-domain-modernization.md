# Shared Render-Demo and Raven Special-Frame Transaction

## Status

This Milestone D corridor is **Experimental (implemented, default-off;
native/static validation passed; runtime and release qualification pending)**.
`r_rendererSharedSpecialFrame 1` gives OpenGL and Vulkan the same sealed
ownership boundary for two otherwise exceptional classic-frame paths:

- a complete 3D frame being played from the active render-demo session stream;
  and
- an exact `RC_DRAW_SPECIAL_EFFECTS` Raven controller command, including its
  later blur composite and projected AL-light work.

The implementation is original openQ4 work. It incorporates no external source
code and changes no stock Quake 4 asset.

## Transaction boundary

A negative `viewID` is not sufficient evidence of render-demo playback: the
portal-sky camera uses that convention too. Front-end scene packets therefore
mark a render-demo view only when the live `session->readDemo` stream owns the
same render world. The record then seals the ordinary root-view identity,
demo-version state, full source surface count, exact packet associations, and
depth, interaction, and ambient pass presence.

Raven special effects are command-only work. Their packet preserves the exact
controller view and the admitted `SPECIAL_EFFECT_BLUR` / `SPECIAL_EFFECT_AL`
mask from `RC_DRAW_SPECIAL_EFFECTS`. The visible work can finish later: OpenGL
reports the blur composite and actual AL lights after their established paths
complete; Vulkan reports its normal or resolve-backed completion after its
pending controller is consumed. Both bits must complete before the record is
owned.

Neither route replaces any mature rendering behavior. A render-demo record
dispatches the complete normal 3D view executor. Special effects retain their
normal renderer-resource preparation, depth/color/resolve handling, blur, and
projected-light paths. The shared transaction seals provenance and completion;
it is not a second demo decoder or a replacement BSE/effect renderer.

## Eligibility and fallback

Render-demo ownership accepts only a complete ordinary root 3D view from the
active session stream. Portal-sky, subview, mirror, x-ray, editor, clip-plane,
and malformed/partial packet cases are rejected. Special-frame ownership accepts
only the exact normal-root Raven controller command with a nonempty admitted
mask. Packet overflow, source mismatch, stale/missing session state,
unsupported view shape, incomplete effect output, resolve/capture state, or a
backend rejection leaves the whole item on the classic fallback path.

Ownership is reported only after complete coverage: a demo must reconcile its
entire source-surface count, while Raven blur and AL coverage are accumulated
until they match the sealed mask. An unreported record is finalized as a named
classic fallback, so a partial shared report can never silently hide an
unfinished special effect.

## Control and diagnostics

`r_rendererSharedSpecialFrame` is independent of GUI, cinematic/post, world
ambient, interaction, fog/blend, subview, and deform ownership:

- `0` (default): render-demo and Raven special-frame work use their normal
  backend paths;
- `1`: an eligible sealed transaction may report OpenGL/Vulkan ownership after
  the same complete executor finishes; all other work remains classic-owned.

`gfxInfo` reports source scenes, demo/effect records, admitted effect mask,
ready/fallback views, semantic hash, and per-backend ownership, fallback,
coverage-mismatch, and duplicate-report totals. Focused dependency-light
validation is:

```text
rendererScenePacketSelfTest
rendererClassicSpecialFrameDomainSelfTest
gfxInfo
```

`tools/tests/renderer_classic_special_frame_domain.py` guards exact session
provenance, portal-sky exclusion, controller-mask capture, source validation,
OpenGL/Vulkan completion handoff, conservative defaults, release-harness
isolation, diagnostics, and CI registration.

## Remaining qualification

Before promotion, retain engine-written `screenshot` captures—not OS
captures—for a stock render-demo and a stock Raven blur/AL scene with the
setting off and on, separately on OpenGL and Vulkan. Require nonzero reconciled
ownership where the content is eligible, exact same-settings output, an
incomplete-mask zero-commit fallback, clean backend diagnostics, and fresh
staged-package and target-platform/driver evidence.

The direct special-subview transaction now covers direct mirror/clip-plane and
dynamic mirror/reflection/x-ray handoffs; see [Shared Special-Subview
Transaction](classic-subview-domain-modernization.md). Unsupported special-view
nesting ownership is the next Milestone D target. Temporal presentation
and PBR/advanced lighting remain downstream.
