// openQ4 underwater view.
//
// A scene pass: it runs inside the 3D view, on the finished world, before the HUD and any menu are
// drawn, so only the world goes under the water.
//
// The thing that makes water read as a volume rather than a colour filter is that everything it
// does gets stronger with distance. So this is built around the depth buffer:
//
//   1. Absorption (Beer-Lambert). Light loses red first, then green, then blue, exponentially with
//      how far it travelled. underwaterTint is the transmittance at fogDistance, so the per-channel
//      extinction falls out of it directly and a designer only has to pick a colour and a range.
//   2. In-scattering. What absorption takes away, the water puts back as its own colour - that is
//      why distant things go flat and pale rather than simply dark. Together these two are what
//      turns a tint into a volume.
//   3. Scattering blur. Distance softens; near surfaces stay sharp. A rotated six-tap ring, so the
//      falloff has no axis to give it away, with a small radial term on top for the mask.
//   4. Bloom. Suspended particulate throws light sideways, so every bright source grows a halo -
//      and the halo grows with the distance the light has travelled to reach you. This is the most
//      recognisable single cue that a scene is underwater.
//   5. Refraction, chromatic aberration, vignette, caustics and marine snow: the lens and the
//      surface overhead.
