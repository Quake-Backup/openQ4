"""Guards the agreements that keep a multiplayer weapon change consistent.

Reported from a live match: walking over weapon pickups with the trigger held
made the shooter appear to be firing two different weapons at once, most
reliably out of the lightning gun.  Two independent agreements were broken.

  * A multiplayer client strips BUTTON_ATTACK for the whole of a weapon change
    (idPlayer::LocalClientPredictionThink and idPlayer::NonLocalClientPrediction-
    Think both do it), so no client ever animates a shot while a weapon is being
    swapped out.  idPlayer::Think does not, so the authoritative simulation kept
    firing the outgoing weapon.  idPlayer::Weapon_Combat calls PutAway() and then
    FireWeapon() in the same frame, so the outgoing weapon could be told to begin
    a fresh attack after it had been told to lower - and rvWeaponShotgun's fire
    loop re-enters "Fire" without re-testing wsfl.lowerWeapon, spending another
    shell that nobody rendered.  The pickup auto-switch opens that window with no
    input from the player at all.  rvWeapon::NoFireWhileSwitching has to answer
    for every weapon, not just the lightning gun, and idPlayer::FireWeapon has to
    answer it before the CancelReload() branch, which raises wsfl.attack.

  * The world model - the model every *other* player sees - outlives the
    rvWeapon.  idPlayer::SetWeapon frees the weapon object and builds a new one
    against the same idAnimatedEntity, so whatever the previous weapon left bound
    to it plays on over the new one.  rvWeapon::InitViewModel starts with
    rvViewWeapon::Clear(), which stops every effect and sound on the view model;
    rvWeapon::InitWorldModel needs the same, because a weapon freed part way
    through its fire cycle (SetWeapon(-1) out of ReadFromSnapshot, the
    weaponCatchup branch of Weapon_Combat, OwnerDied) never runs its own
    teardown.  rvWeapon::OwnerDied only hid the world model, which leaves bound
    effects running for the respawn to show again.

The single-player tree is a separate fork of the same code and has to be checked
independently.
